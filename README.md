# How-to-create-a-new-custom-dataset-from-images-Medium-Article
We all have learnt how to build machine learning models on the classics MNIST/Fashion MNIST datasets. But, what if you want to train a model to recognise your friends' faces? A dataset for that purpose is not readily available on the internet. 

After working on public datasets for months, I wanted to create a custom dataset of my face images and use it for face identification.  Real expertise is demonstrated by using machine learning to solve your own problems.

Building  your own image dataset is a non-trivial task by itself. Surprisingly, it is covered far less comprehensively in most online courses.

I searched for ways to do it and finally figured it out.  

In this article, you will learn how to prepare your own dataset of raw images, which you can then use for your own image classification/computer vision projects.
